    <h2>Michael's Foccacia Bread</h2>
    <p>This version of the classic <b>foccacia bread</b> is easy to make while remaining authentic and true to the original. This may be the fastest yeast bread you make; it takes only one hour from conception to completion.</p>
    <p>Romano or Asiago cheese are nice to use instead of Parmesan cheese.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
        <li>5 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped rosemary</li>
        <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1:</b> Dissolve honey in the warm water in a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to foam. Stir in 1 tablespoon of salt, 1 tablespoon olive oil, onions, and 5 cups of flour until the dough comes together. Knead on a well floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2:</b> Preheat oven to 415 degrees F (215 degrees C).</li>
        <li><b>Step 3:</b> Place dough onto oiled baking sheet, and flatten to cover the whole sheet evenly. Use the tips of your fingers to make indentations all over the dough spaced about 1 inch apart. Drizzle the focaccia with 3 tablespoons olive oil, then sprinkle rosemary, Parmesan cheese, and remaining 1 tablespoon of kosher salt over the top. Let rise for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Step 4:</b> Bake in preheated oven 20 minutes until golden brown.</li>
